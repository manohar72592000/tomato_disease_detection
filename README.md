# Tomato Leaf Disease Detection
**Navigate to Tomato disease app folder for testing the model**

#Other two folders contain training programs for svm and cnn

Tomato disease app repository contains a Streamlit-based application for detecting diseases in tomato leaves using two models:
1. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
2. A Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Features
- Predicts tomato leaf diseases using both CNN and SVM models.
- Accepts image uploads and provides disease predictions with confidence scores.

## Models
- **CNN Model**: Automatically learns features from images.
- **SVM Model**: Requires manually extracted features.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:

Or

Download files to local envinroment and run **app2models.py** by locating models which are inside this file.
